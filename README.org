* About

A repository that contains a kconfig to enable nethunter support in android kernels.

You would need the appropriate patches for nethunter in which you will find them [[https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-kernel/-/tree/master/patches][here]]

* Usage

** You can add this to your tree by doing this command

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
git fetch https://github.com/cyberknight777/android_kernel_nethunter main
git merge -s ours --no-commit --allow-unrelated-histories --squash FETCH_HEAD
git read-tree --prefix=nethunter -u FETCH_HEAD
git commit -m "Imported nethunter/ from https://github.com/cyberknight777/android_kernel_nethunter"
#+END_SRC

** Then go to arch/yourtargetarchitecture/Kconfig and add this line below:

#+BEGIN_SRC shell   
source "nethunter/Kconfig"
#+END_SRC

** Next you need to enable Basic Nethunter Support option, while the others are purely optional.

* Supported Options
+ =Basic nethunter support= [ consists of sysvipc for postgresql, enabled module support for external modules, hci0 support & mac80211 support ]
+ =Ethernet drivers support=
+ =SDR support=
+ =HID support=
+ =USB support=
+ =WiFi drivers support= [ note only ath9k, mt7601, ralink, realtek and zydas will be enabled ]
  
Once that's done feel free to compile and use your kernel which has nethunter support now :)
